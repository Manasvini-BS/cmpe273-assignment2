# cmpe273-assignment2

->This is the submission folder for Assignment #2. 
I have downloaded httprouter folder from github and kept it in the same directory where my .go file is running.
So I have changed import path for the httprouter to relative path of the folder.
To successfully execute the go file , we have to keep httprouter folder inside same folder where .go file is kept.
Server is running at port 8080 localhost.
